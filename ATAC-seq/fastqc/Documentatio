pipeline {
    agent any 
This starts a declarative pipeline. agent any tells Jenkins to ruin this on all avaible machin.

stages {
#Define stages

#Stage1: Checkout Code

            stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                echo "📥 Cloning the repository"
                checkout scm
            }
        }

checkout scm = Jenkins pull the repo 
Bring all files , including Dockerfile and Jenkinsfile

Stage 2: Build Docker Image

        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                echo "🔧 Building FastQC Docker image"
                sh 'docker build -t fastqc-image .'
            }
        }

Builds the image using the dockerfile. 

Stage 3: Run FastqQC Test 
        stage('Run FastQC Version Test') {
            steps {
                echo "🚀 Running FastQC to verify installation"
                sh 'docker run --rm fastqc-image fastqc --version'
            }
        }


#Runs a container  from the built image 
#Run the fastqc --version command to check if FastQC works
#--rm removes the container after it runs(keeps it clean)



#Final 

    post {
        success {
            echo "✅ FastQC Docker pipeline completed successfully!"
        }
        failure {
            echo "❌ FastQC Docker pipeline failed."
        }
    }


post is for messages after pipeline finishes
